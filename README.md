## Ilias Grigoropoulos

### Welcome and allow me to introduce myself to you...

As an environmental engineering graduate with a master in oil and gas technology, I am affiliated with technology and data analysis. I have worked in the construction industry, also possess business acumen due to my involvement in the retail and sports industry. This varied background results in me working well in cross-functional teams. Programming excites me because I can combine logic with creativity to solve tasks at hand. I like to adopt the Makers way in agile practices and TDD, adjusting my approach whenever necessary.
