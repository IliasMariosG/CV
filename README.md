## Ilias Grigoropoulos

As an environmental engineering graduate with a master in oil and gas technology, I am affiliated with technology and data analysis. I have worked in the construction industry, also possess a business acumen due to my involvement in the retail and sports industry. Due to my background I work well in cross-functional teams. Programming excites me because I can combine logic with creativity to solve tasks at hand.
